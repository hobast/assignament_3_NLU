📄 Project Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a classical Information Retrieval (IR) system using the TF-IDF vectorization technique.
It is designed to process a text-based corpus (loaded from Hugging Face datasets) and return the most relevant results based on a user’s search query.

🛠️ Built With
🧠 scikit-learn – for TF-IDF transformation and cosine similarity

🖥️ tkinter – to build a basic graphical user interface (GUI)

📚 datasets – to load corpora (e.g., AG News) from Hugging Face

⚙️ How It Works
The user inputs a query in the GUI.

The system transforms all documents and the query into TF-IDF vectors.

It computes cosine similarity between the query and documents.

The top-matching documents are displayed to the user in order of relevance.
